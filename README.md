## How does it work?
It scrapes web sites for streamable data and serves it to you, and allows you to
play in any player you want.

## Why is it awesome?
Plugins. And a very simple API. You can create a new Plugin for it in
a matter of hours.

## Use any player you want!
 Use any player that you want! Windows Media Player, VLC, mpv, MPlayer, MPC-HC and
 many more! You can even specify your own command line arugments for the advanced users.

## Auto-updater
PCS updates itself, so you just need to install it once!

## Where can I run it?
Anywhere. Mac, Linux and Windows.

## How do I get it?
At the moment we only support Winodws, to use, install Python 3.X, add `python` and `pip` to PATH and run `start.bat`.

*Installers coming soon.*
